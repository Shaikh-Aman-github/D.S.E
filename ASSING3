Questions 1:
Create a numpy array starting from 2 till 50 with a stepsize of 3.

Answer 1:
import numpy as np
array=np.arange(2,50,3)
print("Array of  integers from 2 to 50")
print(array) 

Questions 2:
Accept two lists of 5 elements each from the user.
Convert them to numpy arrays. Concatenate these arrays and print it. Also sort these arrays and print it.

Answer 2:
import numpy as np
x = np.array([2, 1, 4, 3, 5])
selection_sort(x)

    
Questions 3:
Write a code snippet to find the dimensions of a ndarray and its size.

Answer 3:
x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], np.int32)
type(x)
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
x.shape
(2, 3)
x.dtype
dtype('int32')


Questions 4:
How to convert a 1D array into a 2D array? Demonstrate with the help of a code snippet
Hint: np.newaxis, np.expand_dims

Answer 4: 
# 1D array
In [7]: arr = np.arange(4)
In [8]: arr.shape
Out[8]: (4,)

# make it as row vector by inserting an axis along first dimension
In [9]: row_vec = arr[np.newaxis, :]     # arr[None, :]
In [10]: row_vec.shape
Out[10]: (1, 4)

# make it as column vector by inserting an axis along second dimension
In [11]: col_vec = arr[:, np.newaxis]     # arr[:, None]
In [12]: col_vec.shape
Out[12]: (4, 1)

Questions 5:
Consider two square numpy arrays. Stack them vertically and horizontally.
Hint: Use vstack(), hstack()

Answer 5:
import numpy as np
f = np.array([1,2,3])
g = np.array([4,5,6])

print('Vertical Append:', np.vstack((f, g)))

Questions 6:
How to get unique items and counts of unique items?

Answer 6:

# taking an input list 
input_list = [1, 2, 2, 5, 8, 4, 4, 8] 

# taking an input list 
l1 = [] 

# taking an counter 
count = 0

# travesing the array 
for item in input_list: 
	if item not in l1: 
		count += 1
		l1.append(item) 

# printing the output 
print("No of unique items are:", count)
